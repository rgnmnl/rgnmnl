# My Background

<font size="4">I am a PhD student at the University of Antwerp, with a focus on Biostatistics and Health Economics. I am originally from the Philippines, but spent my formative years in Wisconsin, USA. I hold a Master of Public Health with a focus on Biostatistics from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Prior to Antwerp, I spent some years working as a data scientist, statistical programmer, and biostatistician across healthcare and academic institutions, including the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and Advocate Aurora Health Care (previously Aurora Health Care).

I built this blog to foster my hobbies and as a showcase for my personal and professional projects. My other interests include photography, traveling, calligraphy, and graphic design.</font>
