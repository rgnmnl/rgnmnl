excerpt: A photo series of my favorite things in my neighborhood.
---

I recently bought a film camera from Mori Film Lab in Brussels and I bought a Lomography film sampler to try out. I was mid-roll (Berlin Kino 400 film) when I was challenged to take photos of some of my favorite things in my neighborhood and I am pleasantly surprised with how these turned out.

library(pixture)

paths <- list.files(".", pattern = ".JPG", full.names = TRUE)

pixgallery(paths)
