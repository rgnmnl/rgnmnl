This is a Shiny web app I created for my friends and family traveling to Antwerp in November 2021. Travel restrictions were constantly changing at that time and I wanted to provide them with the resources necessary for their trip.

The app has not been updated since the end of 2021. I'm trying to think of creative uses for it for the future, but for now, I enjoy having it as an artifact of its time.
