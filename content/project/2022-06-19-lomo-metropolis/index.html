<p>Another photo challenge, this time using Lomography Metropolis film. We followed prompts from this <a href = "https://www.chantillysongs.com/2020/01/do-30-day-photo-challenge-for-new-year.html">photo challenge</a>. Here are my fav 15 with descriptions below.</p>
<p>I honestly had no idea what to expect with this film and now I know not to use it during sunny days because some of my pictures outdoors just look overexposed. Some of the photos are still in another yet-to-be-completed-and-developed Portra 400 roll. The photos in the Portra 400 might end up better that some of these so I will probably post another update when that’s developed and scanned.</p>

<p>Someone you love: <i>pretty self-explanatory</i>
<br>Your favorite place: <i>Antwerp is probably one of the best cities I’ve lived in and what else is more representative of Antwerp than its famous train station?</i>
<br>What makes you happiest: <i>I love being outdoors and people watching. Bonus points if it’s at a market.</i></p>

<p>A beverage: <i>A beer from Cafe Ernest. This is when I learned that my little point-and-shoot is not the best camera for food pics. Funny story - I got the stomach flu than night. Not fun.</i>
<br>Mornings: <i>Arriving in Brussels for a day trip.</i>
<br>Evenings: <i>An evening by the Vismarkt in Brussels.</i></p>
