<p>I recently bought a film camera from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/morifilmlab/">Mori Film Lab</a> in Brussels and I bought a Lomography film sampler to try out. I was mid-roll (Berlin Kino 400 film) when I was challenged to take photos of some of my favorite things in my neighborhood and I am pleasantly surprised with how these turned out.</p>
