excerpt: A photo series of my favorite things in my neighborhood.
---

I recently bought a film camera from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/morifilmlab/">Mori Film Lab</a> in Brussels and I bought a Lomography film sampler to try out. I was mid-roll (Berlin Kino 400 film) when I was challenged to take photos of some of my favorite things in my neighborhood and I am pleasantly surprised with how these turned out.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(pixture)

paths <- list.files(".", pattern = ".JPG", full.names = TRUE)

pixgallery(paths,
           caption=c(
             "Very sleek COS store interior", 
             "A diorama in the old shoe scrapers - there are a few spread out in the city", 
             "Nives cafe - beautiful location and a nice place to sit on a sunny day", 
             "Harmoniepark - the view from the Nives patio", 
             "The Provinciehuis", 
             "Cheese", 
             "The Royal Museum of Fine Arts - great place to sit, drink, and peoplewatch", 
             "Rush Rush Coffee - some of the best in the city", 
             "Hunting for good vinyl to add to the collection", 
             "The Kaaien - the typical running view", 
             "Drinking by the Kaaien - the cheap alternative to bars",
             "A little front lawn in Cogels-Osylei"))
```
