excerpt: "A listicle of everything that happened in 2021"
---

I started writing this blog before 2021 ended. I reread what I wrote before publishing and wondered how much of this is information strangers would/should care to know about me, then life happened and now it's February and I'm finishing this post.

When I say I had an exhausting year, I'm not lying. 

<b>1. I quit my job and started a new one - TWICE</b>
<ul>
  <li>I left one of my favorite jobs I've ever had</li>
  <li>I had a short stint in corporate.</li>
  <li>I started a PhD program in Belgium.</li>
</ul>


<b>2. Everyone in my family moved at least once</b>
<ul>
  <li>I gave up the apartment I had lived in since June 2017.</li>
  <li>My mom, my sister and I moved apartments within 1 month of each other.</li>
  <li>Taking stock of everything I ever owned and finding the most appropriate ways to dispose of all the dumb things I've accumulated was hell.</li>
</ul>

<b>3. I had my first major surgery</b>
<ul>
  <li>I had my first MRI</li>
  <li>I was officially diagnosed with endometriosis - a disorder almost impossible to diagnose without surgery</li>
  <li>I am getting a lot better.</li>
</ul>

<b>4. The Milwaukee Bucks are NBA champs</b>
<ul>
  <li>I had the best summer full of fun and friends. I was sober for most of it, but it was amazing. I love Milwaukee forever. </li>
</ul>

<b>5. I planned a pandemic wedding</b>
<ul>
  <li>We booked a venue and decided on a wedding date in December 2020. Planning was unnervingly easy at the start, especially with the early vaccine optimism. Bureaucratic issues almost lost us our ceremony and we found out our marriage application was approved <b>2 days</b> before I picked up all my belongings and got on my one-way flight Belgium. The 4th wave of COVID-19 almost cancelled our party. We're married now and couldn't be happier.</li>
  <li>I'll share the wedding design and photos in another post.</li>
</ul>
