<p>I’ve had an Apple Watch for a while now and I bought it largely because I wanted to start tracking my activity – and to, eventually, analyze this data. In order to do the latter, though, I needed to have owned, worn, and religiously tracked activities using my watch for at least 1 whole calendar year. Now in the summer of 2020, I had some down time and so I downloaded my watch data and started messing around with it. I made plots, but the missing data for the remaining 4 months were really bothering me, so I waited and now, I have 2 full years’ worth of data and one just happened to be during a global pandemic!</p>

<p>Compared to 2019, my 2020 energy and exercise totals didn’t seem to dip too much. I can’t really compare the standing hours, because my 2019 total is missing date from January to October (presumably around the time I upgraded my watch).</p>

<p>I also expected a dip in my energy, exercise, and distance averages. The only significant change is in my daily walk/run distance (I ran a t-test to check), which makes sense because I stopped walking to work for 9.5 months. I really tried to make walking a daily habit, though. How else was I supposed to listen to all my podcasts?</p>
<p>Also, I focused on longer and slow-moving exercises that were kinder to my body. I’m getting old and the DOMS hit different nowadays.</p>

<p>I really wanted to see how much my heart rate varied between the two years. I thought my resting heart rate would increase since I was doing a lot less cardio and was generally more stressed. A few years back (when I drank more and before I started working out), I had a pre-hypertension scare and had to wear a heart rate monitor for an entire day, so a median resting heart rate sub-60 has been nice to see as I hit my 30s (2019: 54 BPM; 2020: 56 BPM).</p>

<p>This was a fun one to make using ggplot2. I initially thought it would be fun to just plot a bar chart of my daily average step count (which is very highly correlated with my walk/run distance, of course), but you can barely recognize the trend, so I added a loess curve.</p>
<p>My step count is generally pretty low during the winter months and the gradual decline from January was probably because I 1) hurt my hand in February, 2) switched to remote working in March, and 3) sprained my groin late May from running too much to compensate for the gym workouts I missed. (I thought I had a sports hernia, so I saw a PT and she said: “pain reliever, ice, rest, and stretch”. Ok!)</p>
<p>The increase in July was when I started walking a lot more until I gradually built up to running again (shorter runs and less frequent). In the bar plot, you can clearly see the 10-day period in October when I had quarantine in Belgium and the gradual increase later in the year is probably because I was in Belgium. I generally walk more there because we live in the city, I can’t drive manual, and I’m trying to avoid using public transportation right now.</p>
<p>In 2020, I had 173 days where I exceeded my 10,000-step goal, which is a lot less than my 259 days in 2019. Gotta work on that this year!</p>

<p>I thought I’d make the same plot for my total daily exercise time. Honestly, no groundbreaking discoveries there. I exercised just a little more over the summer, but I also don’t “record” walks when I’m traveling so those steps later in the year weren’t counted as “exercise”. When I’m not in Milwaukee, walking seems less like a chore.</p>

<p>My most active day of 2020 was Thanksgiving Day, which we spent walking around all of Brussels. I wanted to see the Christmas tree in the Grote Markt and to get some Pasteis de Nata from a place in Saint-Gilles. The city was fairly empty, so it was both eerie and cool to see. Here’s a photo!</p>

<h4>
An activity I wish I did more…
</h4>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/cyc-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>With the shift to more outdoor activities, I picked up my bike and rode more. But not a lot. I went on 19 rides last year compared to the 5 rides I did in 2019. My distances significantly increased, but there’s only so far I could go around here without getting too bored too quickly.</p>
<h4>
But this is all just for fun…
</h4>
<p>Of course, much of this blog post is anecdotal. I can’t be entirely certain a change in my resting HR can be directly attributed to one thing or if my heart rate even really increased at all <i>(read “Causal Inference” by Miguel A. Hernán, James M. Robins</i>). I haven’t been very good at recalibrating my watch so again, not sure if these numbers are 100% accurate. Additionally, there may be discrepancies in some of the data collected, because I have used other apps such as Strava, Nike Run, Peloton, which probably collect data differently.</p>
<p>One thing I am certain of is that I will not be making big health related decisions based on what my watch tells me. My wrist will just feel funny if I don’t have it on.</p>
