I’ve had an Apple Watch for a while now and I bought it largely because I wanted to start tracking my activity – and to, eventually, analyze this data. In order to do the latter, though, I needed to have owned, worn, and religiously tracked activities using my watch for at least 1 whole calendar year. Now in the summer of 2020, I had some down time and so I downloaded my watch data and started messing around with it. I made plots, but the missing data for the remaining 4 months were really bothering me, so I waited and now, I have 2 full years’ worth of data and one just happened to be during a global pandemic!

<h4>2020 – An overview of a year of anxiety driven activities</h4>

```{r dt, include=FALSE}
dt <- matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 3)
rownames(dt) <- c("Total Energy Burned", "Total Time Spent Exercising", "Total Standing Hours")
colnames(dt) <- c("2019", "2020")

### Total Energy Burned
dt[1,2] <- sum(watch_2020_wide$TotalEnergy, na.rm = TRUE)
dt[1,1] <- sum(watch_2019_wide$TotalEnergy, na.rm = TRUE)

### Total Exercise Time
dt[2,1] <- sum(watch_2019_wide$ExerciseTime, na.rm = TRUE)
dt[2,2] <- sum(watch_2020_wide$ExerciseTime, na.rm = TRUE)

### Total Stand Time
dt[3,1] <- sum(watch_2019_wide$StandTimeHr, na.rm = TRUE)
dt[3,2] <- sum(watch_2020_wide$StandTimeHr, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r dt_table, echo=FALSE}
dt %>%
  kableExtra::kbl() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

Compared to 2019, my 2020 energy and exercise totals didn’t seem to dip too much. I can’t really compare the standing hours, because my 2019 total is missing date from January to October (presumably around the time I upgraded my watch).


```{r da, include=FALSE}
da <- matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 3)
rownames(da) <- c("Daily Average Energy Burned", "Daily Average Time Spent Exercising", "Daily Average Walk/Run Distance")
colnames(da) <- c("2019", "2020")

### Daily Average Energy Burned
da[1,1] <- mean(watch_2019_wide$TotalEnergy, na.rm = TRUE)
da[1,2] <- mean(watch_2020_wide$TotalEnergy, na.rm = TRUE)

### Daily Average Exercise Time
da[2,1] <- mean(watch_2019_wide$ExerciseTime, na.rm = TRUE)
da[2,2] <- mean(watch_2020_wide$ExerciseTime, na.rm = TRUE)

### Daily Average Walk/Run Distance
da[3,1] <- mean(watch_2019_wide$WalkRunDistance, na.rm = TRUE)
da[3,2] <- mean(watch_2020_wide$WalkRunDistance, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r da_table, echo=FALSE}
da %>%
  round(., 2) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

I also expected a dip in my energy, exercise, and distance averages. The only significant change is in my daily walk/run distance (I ran a t-test to check), which makes sense because I stopped walking to work for 9.5 months. I really tried to make walking a daily habit, though. How else was I supposed to listen to all my podcasts?

Also, I focused on longer and slow-moving exercises that were kinder to my body. I’m getting old and the DOMS hit different nowadays.

```{r hr, include=FALSE}
hr <- matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 4)
rownames(hr) <- c("Average Minimum Heart Rate", "Average Daily Heart Rate", "Average Maximum Heart Rate", "Daily Heart Rate SD")
colnames(hr) <- c("2019", "2020")

### Min
hr[1,1] <- mean(heartrate$min_2019, na.rm = TRUE)
hr[1,2] <- mean(heartrate$min_2020, na.rm = TRUE)

### Mean
hr[2,1] <- mean(heartrate$mean_2019, na.rm = TRUE)
hr[2,2] <- mean(heartrate$mean_2020, na.rm = TRUE)

### Max
hr[3,1] <- mean(heartrate$max_2019, na.rm = TRUE)
hr[3,2] <- mean(heartrate$max_2020, na.rm = TRUE)

### SD
hr[4,1] <- mean(heartrate$sd_2019, na.rm = TRUE)
hr[4,2] <- mean(heartrate$sd_2020, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r hr_table, echo=FALSE}
hr %>%
  round(., 2) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

I really wanted to see how much my heart rate varied between the two years. I thought my resting heart rate would increase since I was doing a lot less cardio and was generally more stressed. A few years back (when I drank more and before I started working out), I had a pre-hypertension scare and had to wear a heart rate monitor for an entire day, so a median resting heart rate sub-60 has been nice to see as I hit my 30s (2019: 54 BPM; 2020: 56 BPM).

```{r steps, echo=FALSE}
stepcolormonth <- c("#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f")

steps <- watch_2020_wide %>% group_by(month) %>%
  ggplot(.) +
  geom_col(aes(x=date, y=StepCount, fill = month), size = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=date, y=StepCount), size = 0.7, colour = "#8d2f57", se = FALSE) + 
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = stepcolormonth, guide = FALSE) +
  xlab("Month") + 
  ylab("Total Daily Steps") +
  ggtitle("My daily step total in 2020") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#8d2f57", size=14, face="bold.italic"),
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank())
print(steps)
```

This was a fun one to make using ggplot2. I initially thought it would be fun to just plot a bar chart of my daily average step count (which is very highly correlated with my walk/run distance, of course), but you can barely recognize the trend, so I added a loess curve.

My step count is generally pretty low during the winter months and the gradual decline from January was probably because I 1) hurt my hand in February, 2) switched to remote working in March, and 3) sprained my groin late May from running too much to compensate for the gym workouts I missed. (I thought I had a sports hernia, so I saw a PT and she said: “pain reliever, ice, rest, and stretch”. Ok!)

The increase in July was when I started walking a lot more until I gradually built up to running again (shorter runs and less frequent). In the bar plot, you can clearly see the 10-day period in October when I had quarantine in Belgium and the gradual increase later in the year is probably because I was in Belgium. I generally walk more there because we live in the city, I can’t drive manual, and I’m trying to avoid using public transportation right now.

In 2020, I had 173 days where I exceeded my 10,000-step goal, which is a lot less than my 259 days in 2019. Gotta work on that this year!

```{r ex, echo=FALSE}
stepcolormonth <- c("#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f", "#79d1dd", "#fcbe4f")

ex <- watch_2020_wide %>% group_by(month) %>%
  ggplot(.) + 
  geom_col(aes(x=date, y=ExerciseTime, fill = month), size = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=date, y=ExerciseTime), size = 0.7, colour = "#8d2f57", se = FALSE) + 
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = stepcolormonth, guide = FALSE) +
  xlab("Month") + 
  ylab("Total Daily Exercise Time (in minutes)") +
  ggtitle("How much of my day was spent exercising in 2020") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#8d2f57", size=14, face="bold.italic"),
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank())
print(ex)

```

I thought I’d make the same plot for my total daily exercise time. Honestly, no groundbreaking discoveries there. I exercised just a little more over the summer, but I also don’t “record” walks when I’m traveling so those steps later in the year weren’t counted as “exercise”. When I’m not in Milwaukee, walking seems less like a chore. 

<h4>A tiring Thanksgiving</h4>

```{r nov26, include=FALSE}
Nov26 <- subset(watch_2020_wide, date == "2020-11-26") %>% 
  select(., c("date", "ExerciseTime", "StandTimeHr", "WalkRunDistance", "StepCount", "TotalEnergy")) %>%
  column_to_rownames(., "date")
```

```{r nov26_table, echo=FALSE}
Nov26 %>%
  round(., 2) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

My most active day of 2020 was Thanksgiving Day, which we spent walking around all of Brussels. I wanted to see the Christmas tree in the Grote Markt and to get some Pasteis de Nata from a place in Saint-Gilles. The city was fairly empty, so it was both eerie and cool to see. Here’s a photo!

<h4>An activity I wish I did more...</h4>

```{r cyc, echo=FALSE}
cyc <- watch_2020_wide %>% group_by(month) %>%
  ggplot(.) + 
  geom_col(aes(x=date, y=Cycling), size = 0.5, fill = "#79d1dd") +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=date, y=Cycling), size = 0.7, colour = "#8d2f57", se = FALSE) + 
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  xlab("Month") + 
  ylab("Total Cycling Distance (in miles)") +
  ggtitle("How much I cycled in 2020 (not much, but more than usual)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#8d2f57", size=14, face="bold.italic"),
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank())
print(cyc)
```

With the shift to more outdoor activities, I picked up my bike and rode more. But not a lot. I went on 19 rides last year compared to the 5 rides I did in 2019. My distances significantly increased, but there’s only so far I could go around here without getting too bored too quickly.

<h4>But this is all just for fun…</h4>

Of course, much of this blog post is anecdotal. I can’t be entirely certain a change in my resting HR can be directly attributed to one thing or if my heart rate even really increased at all <i>(read “Causal Inference” by Miguel A. Hernán, James M. Robins</i>). I haven’t been very good at recalibrating my watch so again, not sure if these numbers are 100% accurate. Additionally, there may be discrepancies in some of the data collected, because I have used other apps such as Strava, Nike Run, Peloton, which probably collect data differently.

One thing I am certain of is that I will not be making big health related decisions based on what my watch tells me. My wrist will just feel funny if I don't have it on.
